//Graph is a non linear data structure that consists of a finite number of vertices
// also callled nodes  connected by edges

// Graph Visualization 

// types of the graph on the edges of the charactrstics 2
// 1 Directed Graph
// 2 unDirected Graph

//  1 Directed Graph
// a Graph in which the edges have a direction 
// Edges are usually represented by arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed

 //   a
 // b    c

 // abc is the traveling  in directed graph 


 // 2 undirected Graph
 // a graph in which the edges are bidirectional
 // the graph can be traversed in either direction
 // the absence of an arrow tells us that the graph is undirected 
 //    a
   // b    c
// a-b-c  both side travel
// c-b-a

// more graph types is here 
//1 graph can have only vertices with no adjeges  
//2 multiple edges from one nodes
//3 cycles in the graph 
//4 self loops on the node 
//5 self loop disconnected
//6 weights on edges 

// Graph Usages in the real world 
// google maps where citys are represented as vertices and road are edges 
// social media sites users are considered as verticeas edges are link between connection
// facbook linkdin // instagram usases graph to show mutual connection's post and recommendation
